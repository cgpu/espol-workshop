# Day 2 schedule

Day 2 focus is data science tools, and basic statistical analyses.

## Basics of scripting for data analysis

* Learn to use a code editor, not MS Word. A code editor works on plain text and gives you total transparency.
* The default text editor on MS Windows is Notepad, on Mac OS is TextEdit. A few free code editors I've used include Atom, VS Code and Geany.
* Beginners should avoid IDEs (Integrated Development Environment, e.g. Eclipse)
* Rstudio, Matlab, IPython are not exactly programming IDEs, more interactive environment for data analysis.
* Command line is empowering. A good tutorial on UNIX Shell is http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/
* Understand absolute and relative paths on computers (Google it)


## Schedule
