*15 minutes break*


3. Starting hand-on pathway analysis

  - Using KEGG and MetaboAnalyst
  - Use ForPathwayAnalysis_targeted_significant_list


4. Pathway and network analysis - general principles

*Lunch break*

4. Pathway and network analysis - mummichog


5. Continued hand-on session on pathway and network analysis

Please use the day3_handon_execuable.ipynb notebook.
Try to reproduce the results on the notebook.


*15 minutes break*


6. Cytoscape and Metscape

Download and install Cytoscape from
https://cytoscape.org/ .

Install MetScape within Cytoscape -
  go to Apps then App Manager, search for MetScape and install as an App to Cytoscape.

Click Apps/MetScape "Build networks" to use.

We will use the same list of metabolites in Part 3 for this as input.
