# Day 4 schedule

Day 4 focus is biomedical applications.


1. Application of metabolomics to precision medicine


*15 minutes break*


2. Metabolite annotation and reporting

Important to the execution of research projects and writing scientific manuscripts.


3. How metabolomics is applied to exposome and environmental health


*Lunch break*


4. Hand-on session on MWAS and data presentation

We will test the association of antibody response to metabolomic profile in the HZ vaccine study.

The data were prepared for this exercise:
  * HZ_antibody_day28v0.tsv
  * HZ_metabolomics_day0.tsv

In real world situations, one needs to wrangle the data to the correct formats. An example is provided as
  * day4_extra_reference_data_wrangling.html


*15 minutes break*


5. Participant project discussions
